Significant changes to the shades package are laid out below for each release.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.2.0

- The package has been reworked to use functions from base R to warp colour
  coordinates between spaces and so on. It therefore no longer depends on the
  "colorspace" package, but the list of supported colour spaces has changed
  somewhat as a result.
- The warp() function has been added for colour space conversions.
- New function complement() returns complementary colours, while addmix() and
  submix(), plus infix shorthands, implement additive and subtractive colour
  mixing.
- The new distance() function can be used to calculate a standardised measure
  of the perceptual "distance" between colours.
- The shade class gains indexing and equality operators, plus methods for c(),
  rep() and all.equal().
- There are now accessor functions space() and coords(), for obtaining the
  current space and coordinates of colour vectors.
- The swatch() function now draws grey borders around colour boxes, to make
  the delineation of near-white colours clearer.
